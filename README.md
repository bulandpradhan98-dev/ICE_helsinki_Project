Question is how we can baseline or what is Surface State Classification ( Per Segment/time )
bare asphalt, Packed snow, loose snow, Slush/wet snow, ice/suspected low traction, gravel/grit (anti skid material present), mixed surface patchy.
<br>
Coverage & Distribution , % of road covered by snow , % of road covered by gravel or grit, patchness index (how uneven it is)
<br>
Maintenance Effectiveness / Priority -- needs plowing, needs salting/gritting, needs sweeping , black ice risk
<br>
audio in low frequencies + vibrations cues (if any) - gravel rattle signatures, short tansient events (hitting grit , small stones)

VISION ONLY - may confuse between wet asphalt vs ice vs slush in some lighting 
where as Audio can distinguish crunch vs rattle (gravel) vs hiss (wet asphalt). Together you reduce false positives.

what should i do with the vision
1. Road surface Segmentation, snow, gravel , Bare asphalt (dark) , wet surface , Slush ,  i need to segment all as per this
